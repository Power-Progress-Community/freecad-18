FreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for 
CAD, MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering 
and product design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, 
such as architecture or other engineering specialties. It is 100% Open 
Source (LGPL2+ license) and extremely modular, allowing for very 
advanced extension and customization.

FreeCAD is based on OpenCASCADE, a powerful geometry kernel, features an 
Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the 
Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API. The interface is built with Qt. 
FreeCAD runs exactly the same way on Windows, Mac OSX, BSD and Linux 
platforms.
